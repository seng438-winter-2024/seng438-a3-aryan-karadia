# 1 Introduction

Text…

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

Text…

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

We used the coverage tool EclEmma for Eclipse. A con we found when using this tool is that it would not run with Mock objects and we had to convert our tests from Mock objects to actual objects that implemented the Values2D interface, in our case we chose the class DefaultKeyedValues2D.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.
