# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal and Range.getLowerBound methods

**Def-Use Sets Per Statement of DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal:**
1. ParamChecks.nullNotPermitted(data, "data");
Def-set: data (parameter)
Use-set: None

3. double total = 0.0;
Def-set: total
Use-set: None

4. int rowCount = data.getRowCount();
Def-set: rowCount
Use-set: data (parameter)

5. for (int r = 0; r < rowCount; r++)
Def-set: r
Use-set: r, rowCount

6. Number n = data.getValue(r, column);
Def-set: n
Use-set: data (parameter), r, column (parameter)

7. if (n != null)
Def-set: None
Use-set: n

8. total += n.doubleValue();
Def-set: total
Use-set: total, n

9. for (int r2 = 0; r2 > rowCount; r2++)
Def-set: r2
Use-set: r2, rowCount

10. Number n = data.getValue(r2, column);
Def-set: n
Use-set: data (parameter), r2, column (parameter)

11. if (n != null)
Def-set: None
Use-set: n

12. total += n.doubleValue();
Def-set: total
Use-set: total, n

13. return total;
Def-set: None
Use-set: total

**Def-Use Sets Per Statement of Range.getLowerBound:**
1. if (lower > upper)
Def-set: None
Use-set: lower, upper

2. String msg = "Range(double, double): require lower (" + lower + ") <= upper (" + upper + ").";
Def-set: msg
Use-set: lower, upper

3. throw new IllegalArgumentException(msg);
Def-set: None
Use-set: msg

4. return this.lower;
Def-set: None
Use-set: lower

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

We used the coverage tool EclEmma for Eclipse. A con we found when using this tool is that it would not run with Mock objects and we had to convert our tests from Mock objects to actual objects that implemented the Values2D interface, in our case we chose the class DefaultKeyedValues2D.
