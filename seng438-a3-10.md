# 1 Introduction

In this report, we adopt a white-box testing methodology to guide our selection of test cases for optimal coverage. White-box testing offers a comprehensive approach, allowing us to look in to the source code of the system under test and make decisions on designing test cases to better cover the code. Our focus is on enhancing the current test suites by looking in to coverage criterias including statement, branch and condition coverage.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

We used the coverage tool EclEmma for Eclipse. A con we found when using this tool is that it would not run with Mock objects and we had to convert our tests from Mock objects to actual objects that implemented the Values2D interface, in our case we chose the class DefaultKeyedValues2D.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Requirements-based test generation is a black-box testing strategy, focusing on validating software functionality based on documented specifications without looking into the source code. This approach ensures early defect detection and conforms to specified requirements to create a comprehensive test suite. However, challenges may arise with this type of testing, particularly when requirements are unclear or incomplete. This could potentially lead to inadequate test cases and a limited ability to explore unexpected scenarios.

In contrast, coverage-based test generation is a type of white-box testing technique where we explorie the source code to ensure comprehensive coverage of various paths. This method provides objective metrics, such as coverage percentages, facilitating quantifiable testing and improved code quality. Yet, it may not perfectly align with specified requirements, risking the omission of critical functionality not explicitly covered in the code. Additionally, there's a risk of overemphasizing metrics, leading to redundant test cases and potential challenges in identifying specification issues.

In terms of execution, both methods involve designing and executing test cases, contributing to the identification and resolution of defects. When integrated into an overall testing strategy, requirements-based and coverage-based testing can complement each other, providing a more thorough evaluation of the software under test.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

At first, EclEmma was showing coverage for the test suite instead of the intended class. After researching and changing the settings, we successfully configured EclEmma to provide coverage metrics for org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and org.jfree.data.Range.

After that we faced a challenge in figuring out how to locate different coverage metrics like branch, line, and method coverage within the Eclipse IDE. Initially, it was a bit confusing, but after some research and hands-on exploration, we got the hang of it. 

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The instructions for importing the test suite from the old assignment were helpful and clear. The lab provided a hands-on experience of white-box testing with EclEmma, offering practical insights into this aspect of testing. We did not encountered any notable issues during the assignment.
